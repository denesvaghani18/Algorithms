<p> It contains Solution of problems asked in interviews. Most of the problems are of leetcode. I keep class name as same as problem title mentioned in leetcode. Each problem has problem statement and contstraint mention in a class. One can find test cases under test source folder of peritculare problme.
 I tried to solve problems by multiple approaches and also mentioned time complexity above the approach.</p>

Add Junit5 liberary to classpath to execute test cases.
